Feted as a hero who is saving Europe from Russia’s maw, 
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, on his first official visit to Poland, 
on Wednesday cemented a new axis of shared interests and military power that is pushing Europe’s center of geopolitical gravity eastward.

The Ukrainian leader, 
who traded his signature olive green sweatshirt for a more formal black one,
 won strong backing from Polish leaders for his country’s rapid entry into NATO — still a remote prospect given the wariness of Western European members — 
 and signed a deal paving the way for the joint production of arms and ammunition.

While scattered street protests by Polish farmers angry at a glut of Ukrainian grain introduced a sour note — 
and prompted the resignation of Poland’s agriculture minister shortly after Mr. Zelensky arrived — 
the Ukrainian leader received a rapturous reception in Warsaw, the Polish capital, bedecked with the flags of the two neighbors.
